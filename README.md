## 🔌 API Endpoints
Base URL: `http://localhost:8080/api/competitions`

| Method | Endpoint                 | Description              |
| ------ | ------------------------ | ------------------------ |
| GET    | `/api/competitions`      | Get all competitions     |
| GET    | `/api/competitions/{id}` | Get competition by ID    |
| POST   | `/api/competitions`      | Create new competition   |
| PUT    | `/api/competitions/{id}` | Update competition by ID |
| DELETE | `/api/competitions/{id}` | Delete competition by ID |

Similar endpoints are available for `/api/participants` and `/api/users`.


## 🧪 Backend Testing
A manual test class is provided in `backend/src/main/test/CompetitionTest.java` which performs:

- POST: create a new competition
- GET: fetch all and by ID
- PUT: update an existing competition
- DELETE: remove a competition

You can run this file as a standalone Java application to test the REST API functionality.
Additionally, **Postman** was used throughout development to simulate and verify all API endpoints with real JSON requests

## 🖼️ UI Overview  
Once logged in, the app displays:

- filter bar to select competition type and age category
- list of competitions (left side)
- list of participants for the selected competition (right side)
- form to add new participants

The UI is built with reusable React components, clean layout, and async data fetching via the REST API.
